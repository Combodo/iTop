# phpdoc dokuwiki template
This directory contains a template rendering iTop phpdoc as wiki pages.



## special instructions

some tags where added : 
 * `@api-advanced`: it means that a method is an `@api` but mark it also as "complex" to use
 * `@overwritable-hook`: used to mark a method as "designed to be extended"
 * `@extension-hook`: not used for now 
 * `@phpdoc-tunning-exclude-inherited`: tunning tag that inform this template to ignere inherited methods in the rendrering.

some behaviours where added :
 * only public `@api` and `@api-advanced` are showed
 * class properties are hidden (subject to change, but will require to white list them using `@api` tag)
 
known limitations:
 * inline tag do not work properly
 * links are hardcoded instead of using phpdoc routes (adding our own routes was too complex)
 * `@see` tags must be very specific: 
   * always prefix class members with `Class::` (ie: `DBObject::Get()`) 
   * for methods always suffix them with `()`, 
   * for variables, always prefix them with `$`.
   * do not use inline @see 
 * as spaces are used to mark code, the templates have very few indentation, thus they are awful to read (sorry)
 * `@example` 
   * the sentence in the first line (next to the tag) is the title, it  must be enclose by double quotes 
   * the following lines are the sample code. 
   * ðŸ’” since we simply hack the official tag, this syntax must be respected carefully ðŸ’”
    
 

## dokuwiki requirements
 * the templates uses the [wrap plugin](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:wrap).
 * the generated files have to be placed under an arbitrary directory of `[/path/to/dokuwiki]/data/pages`.
 * the html as to be activated [config:htmlok](https://www.dokuwiki.org/config:htmlok)
 * the generated files have to be in lowercase

## installation
```
composer require phpdocumentor/phpdocumentor:~2 --dev
```

## bin
`.doc/bin/build-doc-object-manipulation` and `.doc/bin/build-doc-extensions` contains examples of doc. generation, beware: they have to be called from iTop root directory:
```shell
cd /path/to/itop/
./.doc/bin/build-doc-object-manipulation
``` 

the resulting documentation is written into `data/phpdocumentor/output`
