# Monorale: Raleway Sober

###### The elegant _Raleway_ with numbers aligned and a non-crossing "w".

_Monorale_ is built off [v4020](https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/tree/master/fonts/v4020) of Raleway.

Currently available as `otf` and `woff` files.

#### Why can't I just use _Raleway_ with its alternate glyphs?

You absolutely can! _Monorale_ is just an easy way — especially for web apps — to host a `woff` file with Raleway's aligned numbers and alternate "w" as the default.

#### How is this different from _Rawline_?

[Rawline: Raleway With "Fixed" Numerals](https://github.com/h-ibaldo/Raleway_Fixed_Numerals/) still uses Raleway's criss-crossing "w". I also noticed all text was being shifted-down, especially SVGs.
