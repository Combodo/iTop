/**
 * Interface iUIBlockFactory
 *
 * The UIBlockFactories should be prefered rathan than manually instantiating UIBlocks via their constructor for several reasons:
 *   * Factories' prototypes should be consistent over time
 *   * Factories that a block style will be consistent with the whole app. UI style over time (eg. Success messages are displayed in green in the app. If you manually create a green one for your purpose, if in the future we change success messages to be blue, yours will stay green, loosing their semantic meaning. Using the factories properly, your usages will migrate with the app. UI style seemlessly)
