   * Careful: Here we get all the "descendants" instead of the first closest panel in the modal, which could cause some glitches in the future.
   * For now we decided to stay that way for the following reasons, if that changes in the future keep the repercussions on descendants panels in mind.
   * - We don't have nested sticky panels (yet)
   * - We don't want to hardcode the modal's markup selector if not necessary as it could change in the future (and is already different in read-only vs edition)
   * - Unlike in JS, there no easy way to find the closest descendant
