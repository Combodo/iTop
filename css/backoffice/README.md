## Description
This is a brief description of the SASS 7-1 system and how to use it.
- [File structure](#file-structure)
- [Usage](#usage)

## File structure
SCSS files are structured following the [7-1 pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern). \
@rveitch made a great summary with the following, which can also be found [here](https://gist.github.com/rveitch/84cea9650092119527bc).

_Note: Folders with an * are customizations we made to the original 7-1 pattern to best fit our needs_

    - Variables
    - Functions
    - Mixins
    - Helpers
- Vendors
- Base
- Components
- Layout
- \*Application
- Pages
- \*Block integrations
- Themes
