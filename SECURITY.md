# üîí Reporting vulnerabilities

We take all security bugs seriously. Thank you for improving the security of iTop! We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.


## ‚úâÔ∏è How to report

### iTop vulnerabilities
Please send a procedure to reproduce iTop vulnerabilities to security@combodo.com.

You can send us a standard given / then / when, including iTop version, impacts, and maybe installed modules or datas if they are needed to reproduce.

### Dependencies vulnerabilities
Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module, and notify us of the report by sending a mail to security@combodo.com.



## üìÜ Disclosure Policy

Report sent to us will be acknowledge within the week. Then, a developer will be assigned to it and will:

* confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
* audit the code to find any potential similar problems
* try to find workaround if any
* create an official report as draft, crediting you as vulnerability finder
* prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance
* send communications to customers, publish official report

Security issues always take precedence over bug fixes and feature work.

The assignee will keep you informed of the work progress, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
