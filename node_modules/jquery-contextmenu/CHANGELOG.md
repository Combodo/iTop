### 2.0.0 (October 28th 2015) ###

* __This version changes the default names of the icon classes in order to stop CSS conflicts with frameworks which define the class 'icon'.__ In order to keep the icon names the same as before this change you can change the defaults on the classnames for the icons ([docs on classNames option](http://swisnl.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/docs.html#options-classNames)). The classnames will probably be "context-menu-icon-*" as proposed earlier by @rodneyrehm.
* You can not use SASS to customize your contextmenu. The gulp command build-icons takes all the SVG icons from src/icons and builds them into a font. In order to this we needed to break backwards compatibility. This does mean the new CSS does not have the old .icon class defined which makes it a lot more stable within CSS frameworks. The first revision of the documentation is found [here](documentation/docs/customize.md).
* The 1.x branch will be maintained for a while with bugfixes. But support for 1.x will be dropped in the coming months.
* Reverted the change from 1.7.0: .html() changed back to .text() since it is an security issue (thanks @arai-a)

### 1.10.1 (October 25th 2015) ###

* Added gulp command (integration-test-paths) to change the paths in the integration tests to the correct path after they are overwritten by the documentation generator.
* Make sure the contextmenu is not outside the client area by (thanks to @arai-a)
* Update jQuery dependecy so that it will not result in double installation of jQuery when using npm (thanks to @fredericlb)

### 1.9.1 (October 11th 2015) ###

* Fixed a bug where the classNames options would fail on a submenu.
* New documentation site and generation using [couscous](https://github.com/CouscousPHP/Couscous)

### 1.9.0 (October 1st 2015) ###

* Make classes configurable for those that can easily conflict. See the [docs on classNames option](http://swisnl.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/docs.html#options-classNames). This also prepares to change classnames to non conflicting defaults so the hassle with frameworks as bootstrap will stop.
* Fix for handling of seperator string. It threw an error on the protected property of String.$node
