# bulma-scss

This is a port of the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) project SASS files to the
SCSS syntax.

Currently, these files are based on Bulma version 0.9.4, and will be updated
with later releases. The files are converted to SCSS with
[this script](https://gist.github.com/j1mc/ff1ff83e277b1e221761fc0c0ee3b164).
